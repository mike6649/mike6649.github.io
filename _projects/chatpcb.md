We, with diverse expertise in mechanical engineering and computer science, developed a mobile AR app to streamline and make accessible the PCB fabrication process. We used Google's ARCore and Speech to text technologies to create an interactive experience that guides users through the soldering process. We divided tasks and iterated on designs to ensure usability and efficiency. We overcame challenges in integrating the PCB bill of material database and AR component spotlight feature and accurately identifying solder pad locations of different sizes and shapes. Our innovative mobile AR app reduces soldering time and enhances board accuracy, empowering DIY enthusiasts.
