With a Masters degree in Computational Science & Engineering at Georgia Tech, I am excited to leverage my machine learning knowledge and software engineering background to create performant data-driven solutions.

I am currently working at the [Aerospace Systems Design Laboratory](https://energywatch.gatech.edu/) to build data pipelines and deploy simulation models in production for buildings across Georgia Tech campus.

My interests include scalable model inference, decentralized (federated) learning, and graph neural networks.
